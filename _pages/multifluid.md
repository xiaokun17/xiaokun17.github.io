## Introduction
<!--from docx -->
Fluid simulation is a challenging and dynamic research area in computer graphics and animation community, which are in line with the practical demands of the visual effects and computer animation industry for high quality images. Methods offering fine fluid details, controllable art design, phase transition and diffusion phenomena are valuable for the industry. MultiFluid will develop a multilevel theory and hybrid solution with tools to provide a coherent multi-level enhancement to refine the fluid details and offer user-friendly controls in animation. Within this framework, it will develop a multi-phase interaction and phase-transition model to consider complex physics beyond the state of the art, which aims to create realistic images for computer animation and visual effects production. 

MultiFluid is designed to resolve the mismatch in digital creation. It aims to advance knowledge in physically-based modelling and fluid dynamics with a distinctive unified theoretical framework to incorporate new mathematical understanding in particle-grid based numerical simulation, which tackles computer animation production with priority but also bring new knowledge into fluid simulation with a new numerical approach and tools. This multidisciplinary research is ambitious and revolutionary to combine competencies from fluid mechanics and animation artists to benefit stakeholders directly and generate impact.
